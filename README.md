# Thyroid-Nodule-Ablation
## The effect of limited neck space on moving-shot overlapping radiofrequency ablation in benign thyroid nodule: computer analysis and its clinical application for complete ablation in one session

- Motivation: Achieving safe and effective complete ablation of benign thyroid nodules (BTNs) in a single-session ablation may bring significant long-term benefits to patients. But limited neck space may impact the ability to accurately determine various overlapping modes for complete ablation. The use of computer-generated mathematical models can reduce errors and save time in achieving complete ablation. 
- Results: We accurately calculated the range of electrode adjustment in the neck (cranio-caudal direction) and then utilized computer analysis to determine whether the overlapping ablation mode could be employed to fully cover the BTNs based on the actual angle and size of the BTNs. Subsequently, we retrospectively included fifty patients with fifty BTNs undergoing radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for verifying computer-generated mathematical models. Computer-assisted ablation strategies show promising therapeutic outcomes, markedly improving procedure efficiency, which plays a crucial role in fostering the widespread adoption of thyroid ablation procedures in the future.
